# Xword

A application for creating crosswords. Currently works for OSX.

This is my first time using everything in the project (Qt, QML, JavaScript, C++, GitHub), so any suggestions are welcome. I'm using this project to learn.

Features:

     - Crossword puzzle editor (grid, clues, metadata)
     - File I/O capabilities
     - Export to pdf

Limitations:

     - The exporting to pdf functionality is fairly restrictive, 
     due in part to the largely QWidget-based-ness of Qt's 
     printing functionalities.
     - Only plain text is supported for clues
     - The app icon is set-up for OSX
     - And many more...
