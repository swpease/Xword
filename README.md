# Xword

A application for creating crosswords.

This is my first time using everything in the project (Qt, QML, JavaScript, C++, github), so any suggestions are welcome. I'm using this project to learn.

I have a basic, functional crossword puzzle editor, with full file saving/loading/overwriting/etc capabilities. The next major task is to figure out how to print completed crosswords.
