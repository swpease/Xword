# Xword

A crossword making GUI application.

I am both learning how to use github and Qt with this project, so it will probably be a little messy. I had a nice readme
written up but it was lost to my stupidity.

I have a basic, functional crossword puzzle editor here, written currently in QML and JavaScript (the JS is for the
functionality, the QML is for the visual components). I need to integrate some C++ Qt to make it better.

Things currently to do include:
  1. Make things more legible
  2. Make the app prettier
  3. Add the option to save files
  4. Add the option to print crosswords
  5(?) Add the option to send crosswords to others with the program
